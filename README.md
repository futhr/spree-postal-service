SpreePostalService
==================

A postal service is delivers based on weight only(*). Like most post services in europe will.

This spree extension adds a spree-calculator to model this.

Other features:
  - size and weight restrictions by item and by order can be specified
  - you can also add zip code restrictions
  - you specify a weight/price table 
  - prices in the price table can be by weight unit (kg)
  - handling fee may be added ( with a maximum when it won't be applied anymore)
  - multi-parcel shipments are automatically created
  - you can specify a maximum order price, orders over this will not be charged

Off course this relies on your weight data to be correct (and if you want the restrictions to work, the size data too).
Use the same measurements as in the product info page.

(*) you may install several ShippingMethods for (usually) different countries.

Usage
=======

Add to your gemfile

gem "spree_postal_service",  :git => "git@github.com:dancinglightning/spree-postal-service.git"

Go to admin interface

http://localhost:3000/admin/shipping_methods/new

and use "Postal" as calculator.

The size/weight "table" must have the same amount of (space separated) entries.

Optionally add your own locale to config/locales/  (and if you do, send it to me)

Example:
=======

With the default settings (measurements in kg and cm):

- Max weight of one item: 18
- Max width of one item: 60
- Max length of one item: 90
- Default weight: 1kg  (applies when product weight is 0)
- Handling fee: 10
- Amount, over which handling fee won't be applied: 50
- Max total of the order: 120.0
- Weights (space separated): 1 2 5 10 20
- Prices (space separated):  6 9 12 15 18

Applies?
-------
The Shipping method does not apply to the order if:

- Any items weighs more than 18 Kg
- Any item is longer than 90 cm
